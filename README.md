##Basic suspension calculator used for selecting spring rates, damper valving, and corner weighting

Hello!

My name is Shawn, and you have stumbled on my personal suspension calculator. I built this as a light-weight tool for selecting spring rates, adjusting shocks, and setting corner weights on racecars that I use personally. If you are interested in modified cars that use lowering springs or coilover suspension, you can test values here to see their [theoretical] effects. additional factors do impact the real world, like rubber bushings, tire deflection, and **sway bars** which may be added in future versions.

*The program uses a main menu where you can type numbers 1-3 and press Enter to continue through the program.*

*To exit the program at any point, type exit and press Enter.*

Hopefully this provides some value to other curious car loving developers out there. Cheers!
